# Bot Browser

Browse bots, lorebooks, collections, trends, and your own local SillyTavern library from one place.

## Installation

Install via the SillyTavern extension installer:

```
https://github.com/mia13165/SillyTavern-BotBrowser
```

## How to Use

Click the bot icon next to the import bots button.

![Bot Browser Icon](images/bot_icon.jpg)

Bot Browser now opens in standalone mode by default.

- Use `Hide` if you want to tuck it out of the way without losing your place
- Use `Classic UI` if you want to go back to the older layout
- Use `Back to SillyTavern` if you want to close the standalone view

Browse cards, open the details, and import them into SillyTavern if you want them.

## Search

You can search normally, or use filters when a source supports them.

- **Search All** is for when you do not care which source the bot comes from
- Use `+tag` to force a tag in
- Use `-tag` to force a tag out
- Use source-specific filters when the source supports them
- Toggle which live sources Search All is allowed to use
- Hide NSFW, blur NSFW, blur all cards, or hide locked-definition cards

## AI Finder

AI Finder is a separate full chat window. It is not just a Search All popup.

It can:

- search live sources for you
- keep going over multiple turns
- save chats locally so you can reopen them later
- reference `My Characters`
- reference connected personal feeds and followed creators
- return cards you can open directly

Some models are better than others here. Bot Browser handles the search loop, retries, and parsing extension-side so it works with more profiles.

## Local Library

Bot Browser also works with your own SillyTavern content.

### My Characters

- search your local characters
- sort and filter them
- bookmark them
- open a dedicated local character modal
- inspect the real character fields instead of a thin import view
- edit the card
- jump straight into the SillyTavern chat
- use built-in AI tools to help write or rewrite fields

### Your Lorebooks

- search your local World Info files
- sort and filter them
- bookmark them
- open a dedicated lorebook editor modal
- inspect and edit entries
- add or remove entries
- use built-in AI tools to help draft or expand lorebook content

- **Chub Timeline**
- **Chub Favorites**

Bot Browser now has a much bigger settings surface than before.

## Notes

- Some sources expose full card data and import very cleanly
- Some sources only expose public summaries or partial definitions
- Some features need auth, depending on the source
- Archive sources are useful backups, but they are not full mirrors of the live platforms
- Sites change their APIs sometimes, so a source can break until Bot Browser is updated
